    <p>BCCDC is working with provincial and federal partners on surveillance, diagnostic testing and infection <br> 
        control measures for the COVID-19 outbreak. The information below is for health care professionals and public health partners.
        The United States spends twice as much on health care as the rest of world’s developed nations. In fact, 18% of our gross domestic product (GDP) each year goes to support the country’s health care systems. The percentage of the U.S. economy spent on health care for individuals ages 65 and older exceeds 5% — a proportion that is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050.

        As seniors age, they may struggle to afford soaring health care costs – just as their income is shrinking. According to a recent study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (ERBI), a U.S. couple retiring in 2017 at age 65, needed $280,000 of savings to cover future medical costs. The $280,000 includes premiums for Part B doctor coverage and Part D drug coverage. It does not include long-term care or assisted living.
